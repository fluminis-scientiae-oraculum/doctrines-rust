# Final correctness audit

## Record

Run before merge or release for material changes. Record change/release,
commit, auditor, date, applicable doctrines, focused-review references, and
**pass**, **fail**, **not applicable**, or **waiver reference** for every gate.
This audit checks evidence; it does not infer completion from CI color.

## Required guarantee ledger

Every major domain or case-study claim uses:

| Claim       | Established by                                 | Protected construction      | Boundary preservation         | Escape hatches   | Does not prove | Residual runtime risk |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| exact claim | constructor, transition, protocol, or evidence | privacy/authority mechanism | decoding and persistence path | privileged paths | excluded facts | failure/uncertainty   |

The auditor rejects rows whose claim is broader than establishment evidence.
External mutable facts state observation time and reconciliation. Passing tests
appear under evidence, never as universal proof.

## Exit criteria

Release or merge approval requires every critical item to pass, all focused
reviews to be referenced, the guarantee ledger to be complete, generation and
validation to reproduce cleanly, and residual limitations to be written in the
change record. CI confirms locally discovered results; it does not replace this
audit.
