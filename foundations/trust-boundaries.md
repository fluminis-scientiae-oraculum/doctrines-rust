# Trust boundaries

A trust boundary is a point where data, authority, control flow, or effect evidence enters
from a context whose invariants the current domain cannot assume. Boundaries exist inside a
single process as well as across networks. A database row, cached serialized value, plugin
callback, environment variable, or public constructor can be a boundary.

The central pipeline is:

```text
untrusted representation
    ↓ parse
structural representation
    ↓ validate
trusted domain representation
    ↓ execute
external side effect
    ↓ observe / reconcile
new trusted evidence or explicit uncertainty
```

Validation is relocated and centralized; it is not eliminated. After a trusted type is
constructed, ordinary domain operations may omit repeated local checks only because every
construction and mutation path preserves the documented invariant.

## What "untrusted" means

Untrusted does not mean malicious. It means the representation is not covered by the current
proof. A row may have been written before a migration, by another service, through manual
repair, or under an older policy. An internal message may be duplicated or reordered. A file
may change between inspection and use. A UI may be honest but compromised. A type-safe SDK
may still deliver a stale or ambiguous external response.

Trust is claim-specific. JSON can be structurally valid but unauthorized. An authenticated
principal can be unauthorized for a resource. A database constraint can establish non-null
but not a current cross-service fact. A successful TLS connection authenticates according to
its configuration but does not prove the next business operation will succeed.

## Common boundaries

### HTTP and RPC

Request methods, paths, headers, bodies, query strings, peer identity, and size are untrusted.
Parsing produces DTOs. Validation establishes domain values. Authentication establishes a
principal; authorization produces a scoped decision or capability. Idempotency, retries,
versioning, correlation, and response evidence must be explicit. A client disconnect does not
prove server-side cancellation.

### Message brokers

Messages can be malformed, duplicated, delayed, reordered, replayed, or delivered after
schema evolution. Consumer code validates envelopes and payloads, handles unknown versions,
deduplicates using durable scope, and defines acknowledgement timing. A lost acknowledgement
can cause redelivery after the effect completed.

### Databases

Rows are persistence representations, not trusted domain objects. Decode into a raw row,
validate through `TryFrom`, quarantine invalid historical data, and align transactions with
cross-entity invariants. Schema constraints reinforce domain rules but do not replace
constructors. A successful commit does not include a remote API call unless a protocol
explicitly coordinates both.

### Files and filesystems

Paths, metadata, file content, permissions, symlinks, and directory entries can change.
Canonicalization alone does not defeat time-of-check/time-of-use races. Bound size, resist
traversal, use appropriate atomic replacement and durability semantics, and avoid treating a
successful write call as durable storage without the required flush and directory protocol.

### Environment variables and configuration

Strings require parsing into typed durations, sizes, addresses, and policy enums. Defaults are
policy. Cross-field combinations need whole-configuration validation. Reloads create
concurrency and partial-application questions. Secrets must not appear in ordinary debug or
error output.

### CLI arguments

CLI parsers establish syntax, not necessarily authorization, path safety, or domain policy.
Non-interactive automation may supply stale or conflicting flags. Normalize once, reject
invalid combinations, and retain evidence of the chosen operation.

### FFI

Pointers, lengths, layout, ownership, nullability, string encoding, callbacks, allocator
identity, unwinding, and thread restrictions cross the compiler's safe boundary. A safe Rust
wrapper must validate caller-independent conditions and document obligations that cannot be
checked. Every `unsafe` operation carries a local proof obligation.

### Operating-system resources

Sockets, processes, file descriptors, locks, credentials, clocks, and signals can change
independently. RAII can manage local handle lifetime but cannot guarantee a remote peer,
process, or durable effect remains available.

### External services

Responses establish only the protocol evidence returned by the service. Timeouts, connection
loss, rate limits, and inconsistent reads can make results unknown. Retries require
idempotency analysis. External state observations can become stale immediately.

### User interfaces

Frontend validation improves feedback but does not authorize backend operations. UI state is
a local projection. Navigation, refresh, concurrent devices, expired sessions, and uncertain
submissions require server authority and reconciliation. Preserve user input across retriable
or unknown states.

### Cached serialized values

Caches may outlive code, policy, schema, credentials, or authoritative data. Treat cache bytes
as versioned input. Validate on load and define invalidation. A cache hit is an observation,
not proof of current truth.

## Boundary contract

Every boundary documents:

1. representation and threat or drift sources;
2. size and resource limits applied before expensive work;
3. parsing and structural errors;
4. normalization rules and whether original form is retained;
5. domain validation and policy version;
6. trusted constructor and its visibility;
7. authentication and authorization when relevant;
8. unknown and future values;
9. error categories and sensitive-data handling;
10. operation identity, retries, and ambiguity;
11. evidence tests;
12. residual uncertainty and revalidation.

The contract names an owner. "Serde validates it" is not enough when the derive writes private
fields directly. "The database enforces it" is not enough when replicas, old rows, or migration
scripts use a different schema.

## Parsing, validation, and normalization

Parsing answers whether a representation has a structure. Validation answers whether the
structured value satisfies a domain invariant or policy. Normalization selects a canonical
representation. These operations can interact but should not be mislabeled.

Normalization may be lossy or security-sensitive. Unicode case folding, path resolution,
email casing, and identifier trimming require domain policy. Validate either before or after
normalization according to the intended claim, and test collisions. Preserve raw input when
audit or user correction needs it.

## Protected construction

A trusted type has private fields and fallible construction. Boundary adapters call that
construction rather than reproducing a weaker subset of checks. If several adapters need the
same validation, put the complete policy in one constructor and translate boundary-specific
errors without discarding cause.

Unchecked construction is an escape hatch. If required for verified internal data, restrict
visibility, document all preconditions, and keep it absent from ordinary boundary code. An
unsafe constructor transfers proof responsibility; it does not waive the invariant.

## Unknown and future values

Protocols and schemas evolve. An unknown enum value can be rejected, retained as an explicit
unknown variant, or passed through as raw data depending on compatibility and security policy.
Rejecting unknown fields can harden closed control protocols but can break additive evolution;
it is a policy choice, not a universal default.

Never map unknown external state to the nearest known state merely to satisfy an enum. Preserve
the raw discriminant or quarantine the record. Downstream behavior must be safe under absence
of interpretation.

## Effects and uncertainty

After trusted input drives an external effect, local types cannot guarantee outcome. A
confirmed response can establish success or rejection according to protocol. A pre-send local
failure may establish non-execution only if the request was definitely not transmitted. A
timeout or connection loss after transmission may produce an unknown outcome.

Unknown outcomes carry operation identity, provider reference if known, timestamps, and a
reconciliation strategy. Retry decisions distinguish safe retry, unsafe retry, and
reconcile-before-retry. This is a second trust boundary: external observation becomes new
domain evidence.

## Evidence

Boundary evidence includes parser and constructor rejection tests, fuzz or property tests,
payload limit tests, invalid historical row tests, schema evolution tests, authentication and
authorization cases, duplicate and reorder tests, fault injection, and reconciliation tests.
Integration tests should cross a real boundary where feasible; mocks must not erase ambiguity
or provider-specific failure categories.

Review enumerates all alternate inputs and constructors. The goal is not to call data trusted
early. It is to make the transition from representation to evidence explicit, narrow, and
auditable.
