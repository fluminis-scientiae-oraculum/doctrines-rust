# Normative doctrine

## RUST-DOC-0008-R001 — Trace tests to invariants and risks

**Statement.** Tests MUST identify the invariant, contract, failure mode, or
regression risk they support.

**Intent.** Make suites evidence-oriented rather than collections of incidental
examples.

**Applicability.** All canonical tests and verification jobs.

**Allowed exceptions.** A compact regression test may reference an issue,
incident, or neighboring test module rather than repeat the full invariant.

**Review evidence.** Names, documentation, or manifest mapping from claim to
test.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R002 — Test constructor acceptance and rejection

**Statement.** Validated constructors MUST have positive and negative tests at
meaningful boundaries, including normalization and error categories.

**Intent.** Demonstrate both admitted and excluded value sets.

**Applicability.** Parsers, smart constructors, newtypes, collections, and
configuration.

**Allowed exceptions.** A constructor delegated entirely to a separately tested
primitive may cite that evidence and test its integration.

**Review evidence.** Boundary-value table and assertions on structured errors.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R003 — Use properties for generative invariants

**Statement.** Property-based tests SHOULD cover algebraic, round-trip,
ordering, normalization, parser, and collection invariants when a small list of
examples leaves substantial input space.

**Intent.** Explore classes of inputs and produce minimized counterexamples.

**Applicability.** Serialization, arithmetic, state-machine commands, parsers,
and collection operations.

**Allowed exceptions.** Exhaustive finite domains or directly proven simple
functions may use table tests.

**Review evidence.** Generator domain, shrinking behavior, seed retention, and
property statement.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R004 — Prove prohibited programs where valuable

**Statement.** Compile-fail tests SHOULD preserve important API prohibitions
whose guarantee depends on privacy, ownership, traits, or typestate.

**Intent.** Detect accidental widening of legal programs.

**Applicability.** Trusted construction, capability forgery, consumed handles,
state-specific operations, and trait bounds.

**Allowed exceptions.** Fragile diagnostics may be avoided when a stable API
surface check or compile test provides clearer evidence.

**Review evidence.** Minimal failing programs and reviewed compiler diagnostics.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R005 — Inspect compiler-diagnostic changes

**Statement.** Committed compile-fail `.stderr` or equivalent evidence MUST NOT
be rewritten mechanically without reviewing whether the prohibited program
still fails for the intended reason.

**Intent.** Prevent snapshot acceptance from hiding weakened construction or
transition rules.

**Applicability.** UI test suites implemented with `trybuild` or equivalent harnesses.

**Allowed exceptions.** Pure path, line, or diagnostic wording changes may be
accepted after semantic inspection.

**Review evidence.** Diff review and assertion that the intended error remains.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R006 — Cross real boundaries

**Statement.** Integration tests SHOULD cross the real parser, protocol,
database, filesystem, or process boundary when practical and consequential.

**Intent.** Exercise adapters and assumptions that unit tests omit.

**Applicability.** Boundary conversions and external integrations.

**Allowed exceptions.** Unavailable or costly systems may use faithful
emulators plus scheduled real-system evidence, with gaps documented.

**Review evidence.** Environment description, real components, setup isolation,
and cleanup.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R007 — Protect protocol contracts

**Statement.** Contract tests SHOULD verify request and response schemas,
semantic categories, compatibility, idempotency, versioning, and unknown-value
behavior relied on across independently deployed components.

**Intent.** Detect integration drift before deployment.

**Applicability.** HTTP/RPC, messages, FFI, durable events, and public libraries.

**Allowed exceptions.** One jointly released private component may rely on
end-to-end integration evidence when independent compatibility is irrelevant.

**Review evidence.** Provider/consumer contract, version matrix, and failure
fixtures.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R008 — Control concurrency evidence

**Statement.** Concurrency tests MUST use explicit synchronization, schedule
control, model checking, or observable events rather than sleeps as the primary
means of establishing an interleaving.

**Intent.** Avoid flaky timing guesses and unexercised schedules.

**Applicability.** Locks, channels, atomics, cancellation, and shutdown.

**Allowed exceptions.** A sleep may enforce an outer deadline but MUST NOT be
the evidence that an ordering occurred.

**Review evidence.** Barriers, controlled clock, Loom model, event trace, or
equivalent mechanism.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R009 — Test cancellation and cleanup

**Statement.** Async and concurrent operations MUST test cancellation at
consequential suspension points and verify resource, partial-state, and
external-outcome handling.

**Intent.** Exercise future-drop control flow.

**Applicability.** Partial writes, permits, transactions, external calls, and
task supervision.

**Allowed exceptions.** Pure cancellation-safe reads may share representative
evidence when the reasoning applies identically.

**Review evidence.** Controlled cancellation and postcondition assertions.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R010 — Inject partial failure

**Statement.** Fault-injection tests SHOULD exercise failures before, during,
and after durable or external steps in proportion to consequence.

**Intent.** Verify recovery rather than only returned errors.

**Applicability.** Persistence, messaging, payments, filesystems, and
multi-stage operations.

**Allowed exceptions.** Low-risk pure transformations may not need fault
injection.

**Review evidence.** Crash-point matrix, injected faults, resulting state, and
recovery.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R011 — Exercise distributed uncertainty

**Statement.** Distributed tests MUST exercise duplicate, delay, reordering,
lost acknowledgement, retry, and unknown outcomes when the production protocol
permits them.

**Intent.** Prevent perfect-network doubles from defining false behavior.

**Applicability.** Brokers, remote APIs, reconcilers, and distributed workflows.

**Allowed exceptions.** A protocol may exclude a scenario only with
authoritative evidence.

**Review evidence.** Scenario matrix and explicit terminal or unknown states.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R012 — Preserve failure modes in test doubles

**Statement.** Test doubles MUST NOT erase failure categories, cancellation,
latency, capacity, ordering, duplicate, or uncertainty behavior that is
material to the tested claim.

**Intent.** Keep tests faithful to the risk being evaluated.

**Applicability.** Mocks, fakes, emulators, in-memory repositories, and clocks.

**Allowed exceptions.** A narrow unit test may use a simpler double when the
omitted behavior is outside its claim and covered elsewhere.

**Review evidence.** Double-to-real contract comparison and gap ownership.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R013 — Review snapshots semantically

**Statement.** Snapshot changes MUST be reviewed as semantic output changes.
Bulk acceptance MUST NOT replace explanation of why each affected behavior is
correct.

**Intent.** Prevent expected-output updates from blessing regressions.

**Applicability.** Serialized output, diagnostics, UI, plans, and compiler UI
tests.

**Allowed exceptions.** Deterministic formatting-only migrations may group
equivalent changes with one documented rationale.

**Review evidence.** Focused diff, invariant impact, and reviewer sign-off.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R014 — Treat flakiness as evidence

**Statement.** A flaky test MUST be investigated as evidence of uncontrolled
time, state, environment, scheduling, isolation, or product behavior. Retries
MUST NOT be the sole resolution.

**Intent.** Prevent nondeterminism from being normalized.

**Applicability.** All test and benchmark automation.

**Allowed exceptions.** A temporary bounded retry may gather diagnostics while
the issue is owned and visible.

**Review evidence.** Failure signatures, root cause, deterministic fix, or
time-bounded quarantine with owner.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R015 — Do not substitute coverage for invariant evidence

**Statement.** Coverage percentages MUST NOT be used as the sole claim that
behavior or invariants are adequately tested.

**Intent.** Distinguish executed lines from asserted semantics and input space.

**Applicability.** Coverage gates and quality reports.

**Allowed exceptions.** Coverage may serve as a supplemental regression and gap
discovery metric.

**Review evidence.** Invariant-to-evidence matrix in addition to coverage.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R016 — Separate benchmarks from correctness

**Statement.** Benchmarks MUST NOT substitute for correctness tests, and
correctness assertions inside benchmark setup MUST remain independently
executable where feasible.

**Intent.** Prevent performance samples from becoming weak semantic evidence.

**Applicability.** Microbenchmarks, load tests, and profiling harnesses.

**Allowed exceptions.** A benchmark may validate setup defensively, but the
invariant still needs appropriate tests.

**Review evidence.** Corresponding correctness suite and benchmark methodology.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R017 — Use model checking proportionally

**Statement.** Small consequential concurrent protocols SHOULD be considered
for Loom or equivalent model checking, with the model's abstraction and bounds
documented.

**Intent.** Explore scheduler interleavings ordinary runs rarely reach.

**Applicability.** Atomics, locks, channels, once initialization, and ownership
handoff.

**Allowed exceptions.** Unsupported primitives or state explosion may use a
simplified model plus stress and reasoning.

**Review evidence.** Modeled invariant, bounds, results, and mismatch from
production code.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R018 — Exercise unsafe code with specialized tools

**Statement.** Unsafe code SHOULD run under Miri and relevant sanitizers,
fuzzing, or target-specific tests as required by RUST-DOC-0007.

**Intent.** Add dynamic evidence for memory-model and boundary violations.

**Applicability.** Unsafe internals and FFI wrappers.

**Allowed exceptions.** Tool incompatibility must be documented with
alternative evidence.

**Review evidence.** Commands, results, supported targets, and blind spots.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R019 — Use production evidence carefully

**Statement.** Production telemetry and incidents SHOULD refine tests and risk
models, but MUST NOT be treated as proof that unobserved failures cannot occur.

**Intent.** Learn from real workloads without confusing absence of observation
with absence of defects.

**Applicability.** Operational services and libraries with field data.

**Allowed exceptions.** None for universal claims.

**Review evidence.** Telemetry coverage, detection limits, incident-derived
regressions, and residual uncertainty.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R020 — Keep tests deterministic and isolated

**Statement.** Tests MUST control or uniquely scope mutable external state,
clocks, randomness, ports, files, and environment variables required for their
claim.

**Intent.** Make failures reproducible and parallel execution safe.

**Applicability.** Workspace tests and CI.

**Allowed exceptions.** Deliberate randomized or stress tests may vary inputs
but MUST record reproducible seeds and isolate effects.

**Review evidence.** Temporary resource strategy, seed capture, controlled
clock, and parallel-run results.

## RUST-DOC-0008-R021 — State evidence limits

**Statement.** Every consequential evidence plan MUST state what each selected
test class proves, what it does not prove, and which risks remain observed only
in production or external systems.

**Intent.** Preserve guarantee honesty.

**Applicability.** Feature plans, reviews, and release audits.

**Allowed exceptions.** Trivial local changes may reference an existing suite
contract.

**Review evidence.** Evidence ledger tied to invariant inventory.
