# Normative doctrine

## RUST-DOC-0005-R001 — Treat persisted data as boundary input

**Statement.** Data read from persistence MUST be treated as an untrusted
representation until it has been decoded and validated against current domain
invariants.

**Intent.** Prevent storage provenance from forging domain evidence.

**Applicability.** Rows, documents, snapshots, cached values, event payloads,
and restored backups.

**Allowed exceptions.** None for a type whose name carries a validated
invariant. Trusted storage infrastructure may reduce threat likelihood but not
remove the construction obligation.

**Review evidence.** A complete read-path inventory and conversions that call
the trusted constructor.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— fallible row conversion treats a stored row as untrusted

## RUST-DOC-0005-R002 — Separate models when contracts differ

**Statement.** Persistence models and domain models SHOULD be separated when
their nullability, versioning, normalization, compatibility, or invariant
contracts differ.

**Intent.** Prevent storage evolution concerns from weakening the domain model.

**Applicability.** Most durable business entities and versioned records.

**Allowed exceptions.** One representation may serve both roles when field
contracts are demonstrably identical and decoding still preserves invariants.

**Review evidence.** Field mapping, rationale for shared or separate models,
and tests for invalid stored representations.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— raw row kept distinct from the domain type

## RUST-DOC-0005-R003 — Validate trusted newtypes during decoding

**Statement.** Database and serialized decoding MUST construct trusted newtypes
through their validated public path. A driver mapping MUST NOT write private
representation bytes through an unchecked or unsafe path merely to satisfy an
interface.

**Intent.** Preserve one invariant gate across every construction source.

**Applicability.** SQL decoding traits, ORM hooks, Serde adapters, event
deserializers, and cache loaders.

**Allowed exceptions.** A narrowly scoped internal constructor may accept
evidence already validated in the same operation, with the proof documented and
tested.

**Review evidence.** `TryFrom`, parser, or smart-constructor calls and negative
decoding tests.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— serde and row decode both route through the checked constructor

## RUST-DOC-0005-R004 — Reinforce invariants in the schema

**Statement.** Schema constraints SHOULD reinforce stable value and
cross-column invariants that the database can enforce without duplicating
volatile business policy.

**Intent.** Defend against alternate writers and narrow invalid-data ingress.

**Applicability.** Nullability, ranges, uniqueness, referential integrity,
discriminators, and state-related column combinations.

**Allowed exceptions.** A constraint may remain application-only when the
database cannot express it reliably, enforcement would create unacceptable
coupling, or rollout cannot yet guarantee compatibility.

**Review evidence.** Invariant mapping to domain constructor, schema constraint,
transactional validation, or explicit residual gap.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No schema in repo; zero SQL or DDL files exist

## RUST-DOC-0005-R005 — Avoid contradictory nullable records

**Statement.** Partial records, boolean flags, and nullable associated fields
MUST NOT represent mutually exclusive domain states without a checked
discriminator and a validation rule that rejects contradictory combinations.

**Intent.** Prevent rows such as "paid without receipt" or "failed with settled
timestamp."

**Applicability.** Lifecycle tables, optional payload columns, and soft-state
flags.

**Allowed exceptions.** A deliberately incomplete staging record may exist in a
separate type and table whose lifecycle never exposes it as the completed
domain entity.

**Review evidence.** Row-state truth table, schema checks where feasible, and
conversion tests for every invalid combination.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No example row carries nullable or flag columns forming
contradictory combinations

## RUST-DOC-0005-R006 — Make migrations invariant-aware

**Statement.** Every migration MUST state which invariants it preserves,
strengthens, weakens, or transforms, and MUST define handling for rows that do
not satisfy the target invariant.

**Intent.** Treat migration as a domain transition rather than only a shape
change.

**Applicability.** Schema, data, index, encoding, and enum migrations.

**Allowed exceptions.** A metadata-only operation may state that domain
invariants are unaffected, with evidence.

**Review evidence.** Precondition query, transformation, postcondition query,
rollback or forward-repair strategy, and representative migration test.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: Repository ships no migrations; zero migration or SQL files exist

## RUST-DOC-0005-R007 — Version durable representations

**Statement.** Persisted formats that can outlive one release MUST be versioned
or have an explicit compatibility and migration strategy.

**Intent.** Keep old values decodable without silently assigning new meaning.

**Applicability.** JSON blobs, snapshots, event payloads, files, cache entries
that survive deployment, and database schemas.

**Allowed exceptions.** Ephemeral caches may be invalidated atomically when
version changes, if stale values cannot be interpreted.

**Review evidence.** Version field or schema version, supported-reader matrix,
unknown-version behavior, and fixture tests.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No persisted format carries a version field or supported-reader
matrix

## RUST-DOC-0005-R008 — Plan enum evolution

**Statement.** Persistence of enums MUST define storage encoding, unknown or
future value behavior, rename policy, and downgrade compatibility.

**Intent.** Avoid making source-level variant spelling an accidental permanent
wire contract.

**Applicability.** SQL enums, text discriminators, integer tags, and serialized
sum types.

**Allowed exceptions.** A closed, disposable dataset may reject unknown values
and rebuild from canonical input.

**Review evidence.** Stable encoding table, unknown-value path, migration plan,
and old/new reader tests.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— unknown persisted discriminator is rejected

## RUST-DOC-0005-R009 — Align transactions with cross-entity invariants

**Statement.** A cross-entity invariant that requires atomic observation and
mutation MUST be enforced within a transaction boundary and isolation mechanism
capable of protecting that invariant, or through an explicit alternative
coordination protocol. The design MUST name the concurrency anomaly being
controlled and the residual anomaly set permitted by the selected mechanism,
database, and configuration.

**Intent.** Prevent application prechecks from racing concurrent writers.

**Applicability.** Balances, uniqueness, inventory, state transitions,
aggregate versions, and paired records.

**Allowed exceptions.** Eventual convergence is permitted when temporary
violation is a documented domain state with bounded detection and repair.

**Review evidence.** Transaction scope, isolation analysis against the package
taxonomy, locking or constraint mechanism, concurrent test, and named residual
anomaly set.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No database, isolation level, or concurrent-writer test exists in
workspace

## RUST-DOC-0005-R010 — Prevent lost updates

**Statement.** Read-modify-write operations subject to concurrent writers MUST
use optimistic version checks, locking, commutative updates, or another explicit
lost-update prevention strategy.

**Intent.** Stop later writes from silently erasing changes based on stale
state.

**Applicability.** Mutable entities, counters with derived fields, and
administrative edits.

**Allowed exceptions.** Last-write-wins is allowed only when it is the explicit
business policy and discarded updates are acceptable and observable where
needed.

**Review evidence.** Version predicate or locking query, conflict error,
concurrency test, and caller conflict policy.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: Only a conflict enum name; no version predicate or competing-writer
test

## RUST-DOC-0005-R011 — Preserve transaction-handle lifecycle

**Statement.** Transaction APIs SHOULD prevent use after commit or rollback
through consuming methods or an equivalent runtime lifecycle guard. Commit
failure MUST preserve the distinction between confirmed rollback, confirmed
commit, and ambiguous outcome when the driver or protocol permits ambiguity.

**Intent.** Prevent stale transaction reuse and dishonest commit status.

**Applicability.** Database clients, unit-of-work abstractions, and transactional
repositories.

**Allowed exceptions.** A library-owned mutable transaction handle may enforce
the same lifecycle at runtime when consuming APIs are incompatible with the
driver.

**Review evidence.** Handle transition tests, compile-fail evidence where
useful, and connection-loss behavior.

**Enforcement.** [`reuse_consumed_transaction.rs`](../../examples/compile-fail/ui/reuse_consumed_transaction.rs)
— staging after commit does not compile

## RUST-DOC-0005-R012 — Do not extend database atomicity to external effects

**Statement.** Database transaction success MUST NOT be claimed to include a
message, payment, file, or network effect outside the transaction's actual
resource boundary.

**Intent.** Prevent fictional atomicity across independent systems.

**Applicability.** State changes coupled to publishing or external calls.

**Allowed exceptions.** A documented distributed transaction mechanism may
state only the boundary and failure model it actually provides.

**Review evidence.** Effect inventory, atomic boundary diagram, failure matrix,
and reconciliation path.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: Examples ship no database transaction, so no commit boundary can be
overclaimed

## RUST-DOC-0005-R013 — Coordinate persistence and messaging durably

**Statement.** When a domain transition and message publication must not be
silently separated, the design SHOULD use a transactional outbox, inbox, event
log, or equivalent durable coordination protocol.

**Intent.** Make retry and recovery possible after process or network failure.

**Applicability.** Event publication, job enqueueing, and integration messages.

**Allowed exceptions.** A best-effort notification may remain outside durable
coordination when loss is an accepted, documented outcome.

**Review evidence.** Atomic write, publisher retry, deduplication identity,
retention, ordering scope, and operational lag metrics.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No outbox, inbox, or event log exists; examples avoid messaging
entirely

## RUST-DOC-0005-R014 — Quarantine invalid historical data

**Statement.** A stored representation that fails current domain validation
MUST be rejected, quarantined, repaired through an audited migration, or exposed
as an explicit invalid-record type. It MUST NOT be forged into the trusted type.

**Intent.** Preserve the meaning of trusted domain values while allowing
operational recovery.

**Applicability.** Production reads, imports, restores, and migration scans.

**Allowed exceptions.** None for trusted construction.

**Review evidence.** Diagnostic classification, record identity, sensitive-data
handling, repair workflow, and metrics.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— invalid stored value yields a structured error, not a forged domain type

## RUST-DOC-0005-R015 — Preserve unknown fields and values deliberately

**Statement.** Readers MUST choose and document whether unknown fields or values
are rejected, ignored, retained, or mapped to an explicit unknown variant.

**Intent.** Make forward compatibility and security posture deliberate.

**Applicability.** Flexible records, events, snapshots, and rolling upgrades.

**Allowed exceptions.** None; the chosen policy may be implicit in a format only
if documented and tested.

**Review evidence.** Compatibility matrix and tests for extra fields, missing
fields, and unknown discriminators.

**Enforcement.** [`examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs`](../../examples/boundary-validation/src/lib.rs)
— unknown persisted value policy is reject, and is asserted

## RUST-DOC-0005-R016 — Bound stored-input resource use

**Statement.** Decoding durable values MUST enforce appropriate limits on
length, nesting, allocation, decompression, and batch size before constructing
trusted in-memory state.

**Intent.** Prevent validly encoded but hostile or corrupted records from
exhausting resources.

**Applicability.** Blobs, arrays, compressed payloads, large text, and batch
queries.

**Allowed exceptions.** A format with a proven small physical bound may rely on
that bound and document it.

**Review evidence.** Limits, streaming behavior, oversized fixtures, and failure
mapping.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: Only a name-length constant; no oversized, nested, compressed, or
batch fixtures

## RUST-DOC-0005-R017 — Record persistence guarantees and non-guarantees

**Statement.** Persistence designs MUST document the exact durability,
consistency, isolation, freshness, and external-effect claims they rely on,
including configuration assumptions.

**Intent.** Prevent product names or successful calls from implying stronger
guarantees than deployed behavior.

**Applicability.** Every durable domain component.

**Allowed exceptions.** None.

**Review evidence.** Guarantee ledger linked to database documentation,
configuration, tests, monitoring, and residual failure modes.

**Enforcement.** Unenforceable: No deployed database; no durability or isolation configuration
exists to document
