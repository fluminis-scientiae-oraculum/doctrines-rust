# Normative doctrine

## RUST-DOC-0002-R001 — Define a failure inventory

**Statement.** APIs with consequential failure MUST identify failure categories, caller
actions, commitment semantics, recipients, and evidence before selecting an error type.

**Intent.** Prevent implementation details or string messages from becoming the accidental
contract.

**Applicability.** Public libraries, service operations, external effects, persistence, and
security-sensitive flows.

**Allowed exceptions.** Trivial private helpers MAY reuse the enclosing operation's inventory.

**Review evidence.** Failure table mapping causes to variants, recovery, retry, logging,
protocol status, and uncertainty.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R002 — Use structured library errors

**Statement.** Library APIs MUST NOT use opaque string errors as their primary public contract
when callers can respond differently to failure categories.

**Intent.** Preserve machine-actionable meaning independently of human wording.

**Applicability.** Reusable crates and module boundaries with multiple operational outcomes.

**Allowed exceptions.** An opaque non-exhaustive error object MAY be used when no stable
category can be promised, provided callers have documented inspection or reporting semantics.

**Review evidence.** Public enum or equivalent typed interface, match examples, and stability
policy.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R003 — Distinguish actionable categories

**Statement.** Validation failure, policy rejection, authorization denial, conflict,
cancellation, timeout, resource exhaustion, local I/O failure, and indeterminate outcome MUST
remain distinguishable when they require different caller or operator action.

**Intent.** Prevent unsafe retry, misleading user messages, and loss of reconciliation.

**Applicability.** Any operation where at least two listed outcomes differ operationally.

**Allowed exceptions.** Categories MAY be coarsened at an outer recipient boundary when the
recipient cannot act differently and observability retains safe internal detail.

**Review evidence.** Outcome-to-action matrix and conversion tests.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R004 — Preserve sources

**Statement.** Error wrapping and conversion SHOULD preserve the originating error through a
source chain when doing so is safe and useful for diagnosis.

**Intent.** Retain causal evidence while adding domain context.

**Applicability.** I/O, parsing, serialization, database, protocol, and dependency errors.

**Allowed exceptions.** Security, privacy, compatibility, or cross-process boundaries MAY
replace the exposed source with a sanitized internal correlation record.

**Review evidence.** `source()` chain tests or report inspection, plus redaction review.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R005 — Add context without erasing category

**Statement.** Application context SHOULD identify the failed operation and relevant
non-sensitive identity without replacing machine-actionable categories with formatted text.

**Intent.** Make diagnosis specific while retaining programmatic action.

**Applicability.** Layered application operations, job processing, and boundary adapters.

**Allowed exceptions.** A terminal application boundary MAY use an opaque report after all
control decisions have been made.

**Review evidence.** Context chain, correlation ID, structured fields, and user-facing
redaction.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R006 — State recoverability

**Statement.** Recoverability MUST be explicit at the decision point; callers MUST NOT infer
that every `Err` leaves state unchanged or reusable.

**Intent.** Account for partial mutation, consumed authority, cancellation, ambiguous commit,
and external side effects.

**Applicability.** Stateful, consuming, transactional, asynchronous, and external operations.

**Allowed exceptions.** Pure functions MAY document the conventional no-side-effect error
contract once at module level.

**Review evidence.** Post-error state contract, returned recovery value or token, and tests.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R007 — Type retry guidance

**Statement.** Retryability MUST NOT be inferred solely from a generic transport class,
status family, or error string. Retry policy MUST account for operation semantics,
idempotency, attempt budget, backoff, and external commitment.

**Intent.** Prevent duplicates, retry storms, and repeated permanent rejection.

**Applicability.** Network, database, broker, and other transient-looking errors.

**Allowed exceptions.** None where the operation can cause a consequential effect.

**Review evidence.** Typed retry decision, idempotency analysis, budget, jitter, and fault
tests.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R008 — Preserve indeterminate outcomes

**Statement.** Error conversion MUST NOT convert an indeterminate external effect into
confirmed rejection or non-execution.

**Intent.** Keep the system's account of reality honest and enable reconciliation.

**Applicability.** Timeout, acknowledgement loss, ambiguous commit, cancellation race, or
connection loss after possible send.

**Allowed exceptions.** A protocol-proven pre-commit failure MAY be classified as
non-execution.

**Review evidence.** Commitment analysis, explicit unknown type, reconciliation identity, and
conversion tests.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R009 — Bound panic to programmer faults

**Statement.** Panics MUST be reserved for violated internal invariants or unrecoverable
programmer errors, not expected external, user, configuration, or data failure.

**Intent.** Keep expected failure in the declared control-flow and cleanup model.

**Applicability.** Production library and application paths.

**Allowed exceptions.** Process startup MAY deliberately abort on invalid required
configuration after producing a clear sanitized diagnostic, when continued operation is
unsafe and no caller can recover.

**Review evidence.** Panic-site inventory, unwind/abort policy, and boundary failure tests.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R010 — Justify `unwrap` and `expect`

**Statement.** `unwrap` and `expect` in production paths MUST have a locally evident invariant
or explicit justification showing why failure is a programmer defect rather than expected
input or environment.

**Intent.** Prevent hidden panic contracts.

**Applicability.** Non-test Rust code.

**Allowed exceptions.** Tests and examples MAY use them when the panic is not the behavior
being taught and failure location remains clear.

**Review evidence.** Search results, invariant comments where not obvious, and negative tests
for external input.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R011 — Preserve security and reconciliation evidence

**Statement.** Error conversion MUST NOT erase security-relevant denial, authentication
failure, operation correlation, provider reference, or reconciliation identity needed for
safe action and audit.

**Intent.** Avoid turning an authorization event or ambiguous effect into an undifferentiated
internal error.

**Applicability.** Security, financial, distributed, and regulated workflows.

**Allowed exceptions.** Details MAY be withheld from an untrusted recipient while retained in
a protected correlated record.

**Review evidence.** Internal/external mapping, audit fields, access control, and redaction.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R012 — Prevent secret disclosure

**Statement.** Error display, debug, source chains, protocol responses, logs, and telemetry
MUST NOT expose secrets or sensitive internal data to unauthorized recipients.

**Intent.** Ensure diagnosis does not create a confidentiality breach.

**Applicability.** Credentials, tokens, personal data, SQL, paths, provider payloads, and
security decisions.

**Allowed exceptions.** Restricted forensic storage MAY retain necessary evidence under
explicit access and retention policy.

**Review evidence.** Recipient map, redaction tests, debug implementations, and sample logs.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R013 — Govern public error compatibility

**Statement.** Public error categories and inspection behavior MUST be treated as API
compatibility surface; evolution MUST account for exhaustive matching, non-exhaustive design,
error codes, and downstream recovery behavior.

**Intent.** Avoid breaking callers or forcing unstable implementation details into permanent
variants.

**Applicability.** Published crates, versioned protocols, and stable internal platform APIs.

**Allowed exceptions.** Private application errors MAY evolve with coordinated callers.

**Review evidence.** Semver analysis, non-exhaustive strategy, code stability, and migration
notes.

## RUST-DOC-0002-R014 — Log once at an ownership boundary

**Statement.** Errors SHOULD be logged by the layer that owns the final handling decision,
rather than at every propagation layer.

**Intent.** Prevent duplicate events, contradictory severity, and noisy alerts.

**Applicability.** Layered services, jobs, and request handlers.

**Allowed exceptions.** A lower layer MAY emit a distinct metric or trace event when it adds
unique timing or state evidence and correlation prevents double counting.

**Review evidence.** Error path trace, log ownership, event IDs, and alert mapping.
