# Normative doctrine

## RUST-DOC-0006-R001 — Do not equate timeout with non-execution

**Statement.** A timeout MUST NOT be represented as confirmed failure when the
remote operation may have executed.

**Intent.** Preserve the distinction between stopping local waiting and learning
remote outcome.

**Applicability.** network requests, database commit, broker acknowledgement,
filesystem operations over remote mounts, and subprocess protocols.

**Allowed exceptions.** A timeout may be definitive only when protocol evidence
establishes that execution could not have begun or was atomically cancelled.

**Review evidence.** protocol timeline, cancellation semantics, and explicit
unknown-outcome path.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R002 — Model operationally distinct outcomes

**Statement.** Outcome types MUST distinguish confirmed success, confirmed
rejection, local failure before dispatch, and unknown outcome when callers
require different recovery.

**Intent.** Prevent transport symptoms from erasing domain knowledge.

**Applicability.** consequential external operations.

**Allowed exceptions.** Categories may combine when no caller action, audit
meaning, security consequence, or reconciliation path differs.

**Review evidence.** outcome decision table and exhaustive caller handling.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R003 — Carry reconciliation evidence

**Statement.** An unknown outcome MUST carry or reference sufficient evidence
to reconcile it, including stable operation identity and the external target.

**Intent.** Make uncertainty actionable and auditable.

**Applicability.** payments, messages, provisioning, commits, and any effect that
cannot safely be repeated blindly.

**Allowed exceptions.** An explicitly irreconcilable best-effort action may
retain only audit evidence if business policy accepts permanent uncertainty.

**Review evidence.** reconciliation token, operation ID, request fingerprint,
target, attempt history, and observation method.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R004 — Analyze before retry

**Statement.** Every retry policy MUST classify the operation as safe to retry,
unsafe to retry, or reconcile-before-retry for each relevant failure point.

**Intent.** Prevent duplicate effects and unsafe assumptions.

**Applicability.** clients, consumers, publishers, schedulers, and operator
runbooks.

**Allowed exceptions.** Pure reads may use a simpler safe-retry classification
when staleness and load remain documented.

**Review evidence.** failure-point matrix, idempotency mechanism, deadline, and
attempt budget.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R005 — Define idempotency-key semantics

**Statement.** An idempotency key MUST have defined uniqueness, caller and
resource scope, payload binding, retention, concurrency, replay, and conflict
semantics.

**Intent.** Prevent a string field from being mistaken for idempotent behavior.

**Applicability.** mutable external APIs and durable commands.

**Allowed exceptions.** Naturally idempotent operations may omit keys when their
semantic identity and repeated-result behavior are established independently.

**Review evidence.** key contract, storage constraint, same-key/same-payload and
same-key/different-payload tests, and expiry policy.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R006 — Reuse operation identity across attempts

**Statement.** Retries of one logical operation MUST reuse its operation and
idempotency identity. A new identity MUST mean a new requested effect.

**Intent.** Allow receivers and reconcilers to distinguish replay from new
intent.

**Applicability.** external API requests, published commands, and repair tools.

**Allowed exceptions.** A protocol-mandated new transport attempt identifier may
be added, but it MUST remain correlated to the stable logical operation.

**Review evidence.** identity lifecycle and attempt log.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R007 — Expect duplicate delivery

**Statement.** Consumers in at-least-once systems MUST expect duplicate
delivery and MUST define whether repeated processing is deduplicated,
idempotent, commutative, or safely rejected.

**Intent.** Make acknowledgement loss and redelivery ordinary protocol paths.

**Applicability.** brokers, job queues, webhook delivery, change feeds, and
replayed logs.

**Allowed exceptions.** A verified at-most-once boundary may accept loss instead
of duplicates, with that loss documented.

**Review evidence.** duplicate test, stable message identity, and effect-level
handling.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R008 — Persist deduplication durably

**Statement.** Deduplication that protects a durable effect MUST itself use
durable state with atomic relationship to that effect, and MUST define
retention.

**Intent.** Prevent process restart or pruning from reopening duplicate effects.

**Applicability.** consumer inboxes, payment commands, and webhook handlers.

**Allowed exceptions.** In-memory deduplication may protect only ephemeral
best-effort work whose duplicate cost is accepted.

**Review evidence.** unique key, transaction boundary, retention calculation,
and replay-after-restart test.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R009 — State ordering scope

**Statement.** Ordering claims MUST identify key or partition, producer set,
consumer concurrency, retry behavior, failover behavior, and observation point.

**Intent.** Prevent partition-local or producer-local order from becoming a
false global guarantee.

**Applicability.** brokers, streams, event logs, RPC sequencing, and replication.

**Allowed exceptions.** None when business behavior relies on order.

**Review evidence.** ordering contract and tests for retries, multiple
producers, and failover.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R010 — Qualify exactly-once claims

**Statement.** Any "exactly once" claim MUST identify the precise boundary,
identity, transactional mechanism, failure assumptions, retention, and effects
included. It MUST NOT imply exactly-once behavior beyond that boundary.

**Intent.** Replace a broad slogan with an auditable scoped guarantee.

**Applicability.** messaging, stream processing, payments, jobs, and APIs.

**Allowed exceptions.** None.

**Review evidence.** guarantee ledger, protocol documentation, duplicate tests,
and excluded effects.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R011 — Coordinate acknowledgement with effect

**Statement.** A consumer MUST define the order and atomic relationship among
effect execution, durable progress, and acknowledgement.

**Intent.** Make the duplicate-versus-loss tradeoff visible.

**Applicability.** message and job consumers.

**Allowed exceptions.** Best-effort consumers may acknowledge early only when
loss is accepted and measured.

**Review evidence.** crash-point matrix and tests before and after each durable
step.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R012 — Treat compensation as a new effect

**Statement.** Sagas and compensating operations MUST NOT be described as
rollback. Each compensation MUST remain fallible, idempotency-analyzed, and
capable of an unknown outcome.

**Intent.** Preserve real-world irreversibility and changed conditions.

**Applicability.** distributed workflows, reservations, payments, and
provisioning.

**Allowed exceptions.** A local database rollback may be called rollback within
its actual transaction boundary.

**Review evidence.** forward/compensation pairs, business non-equivalence,
failure handling, and reconciliation.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R013 — Treat observations as time-scoped evidence

**Statement.** External observations MUST record or imply their observation
time and MUST NOT be presented as immutable current truth when the external
state can change.

**Intent.** Prevent stale reads from becoming permanent authority.

**Applicability.** status queries, authorization, inventory, leases, and
reconciliation.

**Allowed exceptions.** Immutable append-only facts may remain stable when the
source contract establishes immutability.

**Review evidence.** freshness policy, version or timestamp, cache behavior, and
revalidation trigger.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R014 — Address concurrent execution and split brain

**Statement.** Where multiple workers or coordinators can act on one logical
operation, the design MUST address concurrent execution using ownership,
leases with fencing, compare-and-set state, consensus-backed leadership, or an
effect-level idempotency mechanism.

**Intent.** Prevent stale owners and duplicate coordinators from acting with
equal authority.

**Applicability.** reconciliation workers, schedulers, failover, and distributed
locks.

**Allowed exceptions.** Concurrent execution is allowed for commutative,
duplicate-safe operations with evidence.

**Review evidence.** authority protocol, expiry, fencing token use, clock
assumptions, and overlap test.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R015 — Bound retries and reconciliation

**Statement.** Retry and reconciliation loops MUST have bounded concurrency,
attempt or time budgets, backoff where appropriate, terminal escalation, and
observability.

**Intent.** Prevent uncertainty from turning into permanent load or hidden
backlog.

**Applicability.** retry queues, reconcilers, publishers, and operator repair.

**Allowed exceptions.** A durable obligation may remain pending indefinitely,
but each execution cycle still requires bounded work and visible age.

**Review evidence.** queue capacity, schedule, age metrics, dead-letter or
manual escalation, and overload test.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R016 — Preserve correlation and causality

**Statement.** Audit trails MUST preserve stable operation identity, attempt
identity, triggering event, parent correlation, request fingerprint, outcome
observations, and reconciliation decisions where these affect accountability.

**Intent.** Reconstruct what was requested, attempted, observed, and resolved.

**Applicability.** consequential distributed effects.

**Allowed exceptions.** Low-risk telemetry may use aggregated correlation when
individual reconstruction is unnecessary.

**Review evidence.** event schema, trace propagation, redaction, and end-to-end
incident query.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R017 — Protect sensitive reconciliation data

**Statement.** Reconciliation and audit evidence MUST contain enough identity
to act without unnecessarily storing credentials, secret payloads, or sensitive
personal data.

**Intent.** Avoid turning operational evidence into a second secret database.

**Applicability.** operation logs, dead-letter records, tracing, and support
tools.

**Allowed exceptions.** Required regulated evidence may be retained with
documented access, encryption, minimization, and deletion policy.

**Review evidence.** field classification, redaction tests, access policy, and
retention.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R018 — Test failure points, not only final errors

**Statement.** Distributed-effect tests MUST inject loss, delay, duplication,
reordering, concurrent execution, and crash points between durable steps in
proportion to risk.

**Intent.** Exercise ambiguity and replay paths hidden by happy-path mocks.

**Applicability.** integrations, consumers, publishers, and reconcilers.

**Allowed exceptions.** A low-risk pure read may narrow the matrix and state
why.

**Review evidence.** fault matrix linked to invariants, test results, and
unexercised assumptions.

## RUST-DOC-0006-R019 — State residual uncertainty

**Statement.** Public and internal contracts MUST state which outcomes can
remain unknown, how long, who owns reconciliation, and what users or operators
may safely do meanwhile.

**Intent.** Make uncertainty an owned lifecycle state rather than an error
message.

**Applicability.** every consequential effect with ambiguous execution.

**Allowed exceptions.** None.

**Review evidence.** state machine, service-level target, escalation path, and
guarantee ledger.
